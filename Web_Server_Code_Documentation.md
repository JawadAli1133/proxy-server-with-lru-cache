# Web Server Code Documentation

## Overview
This document provides explanations for key lines of code in the multithreaded web server with an LRU cache. Each section describes the purpose and function of essential elements used in the code, specifically focusing on concurrency management components.

---

### 1. `pthread_t tid[MAX_CLIENTS];`
   - **Purpose**: Declares an array to store thread identifiers for each client connection, allowing up to `MAX_CLIENTS` to be handled concurrently.
   - **Explanation**: Each element in `tid` represents a separate thread for handling client requests, enabling the server to process multiple clients simultaneously.

### 2. `sem_t semaphore;`
   - **Purpose**: Initializes a semaphore to limit the number of clients accessing shared resources at the same time.
   - **Explanation**: The semaphore enforces a cap on concurrent access to prevent resource overload by allowing only a specified number of threads into critical sections.

### 3. `pthread_mutex_t lock;`
   - **Purpose**: Defines a mutex lock to control access to shared resources, like the cache, ensuring that only one thread accesses it at a time.
   - **Explanation**: Using a mutex lock avoids conflicts by preventing multiple threads from modifying shared resources concurrently, maintaining data consistency.

## Additional Documentation Sections (to be completed)
Add explanations for other key sections as follows:

### `int port_number = 8080;`
   - **Purpose**: Specifies the port number on which the server will listen for incoming client connections.

### `int proxy_socket_id;`
   - **Purpose**: Holds the socket identifier for the proxy server, used for accepting and managing client connections.

### Function: `find_cache_element(char* url)`
   - **Purpose**: Searches for a cache element corresponding to a specific URL.

### Function: `add_cache_element(char* data, int len, char* url)`
   - **Purpose**: Adds a new element to the cache, containing the requested data, its length, and associated URL.
