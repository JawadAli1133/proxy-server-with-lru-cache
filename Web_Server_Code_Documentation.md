# Web Server Code Documentation

## Overview
This document provides explanations for key lines of code in the multithreaded web server with an LRU cache. Each section describes the purpose and function of essential elements used in the code, specifically focusing on concurrency management components.

---

### 1. `pthread_t tid[MAX_CLIENTS];`
   - **Purpose**: Declares an array to store thread identifiers for each client connection, allowing up to `MAX_CLIENTS` to be handled concurrently.
   - **Explanation**: Each element in `tid` represents a separate thread for handling client requests, enabling the server to process multiple clients simultaneously.

### 2. `sem_t semaphore;`
   - **Purpose**: Initializes a semaphore to limit the number of clients accessing shared resources at the same time.
   - **Explanation**: The semaphore enforces a cap on concurrent access to prevent resource overload by allowing only a specified number of threads into critical sections.

### 3. `pthread_mutex_t lock;`
   - **Purpose**: Defines a mutex lock to control access to shared resources, like the cache, ensuring that only one thread accesses it at a time.
   - **Explanation**: Using a mutex lock avoids conflicts by preventing multiple threads from modifying shared resources concurrently, maintaining data consistency.

## Additional Documentation Sections

### 4. `int port_number = 8080;`
   - **Purpose**: Specifies the port number on which the server will listen for incoming client connections.
   - **Explanation**: This variable sets the server to listen on port 8080. Clients can connect by targeting this port on the serverâ€™s IP address.

### 5. `int proxy_socket_id;`
   - **Purpose**: Holds the socket identifier for the proxy server, used for accepting and managing client connections.
   - **Explanation**: This socket ID enables communication between the server and clients, accepting client requests and relaying responses.

### Functions Documentation

#### `find_cache_element(char* url)`
   - **Purpose**: Searches for a cache element corresponding to a specific URL.
   - **Explanation**: This function checks if the requested URL is already present in the cache and returns the corresponding cached data if found.

#### `add_cache_element(char* data, int len, char* url)`
   - **Purpose**: Adds a new element to the cache, containing the requested data, its length, and associated URL.
   - **Explanation**: This function adds a new entry to the cache, keeping track of the data associated with the URL. It is crucial for implementing the LRU cache mechanism by replacing the least recently used items when the cache is full.

## LRU Cache Documentation

### Cache Structure
- **Purpose**: The LRU cache stores a limited number of recent URL requests to avoid repeatedly fetching data from the original source, improving server performance.
- **Explanation**: The cache evicts the least recently used items when it reaches its maximum capacity, ensuring that the most frequently accessed URLs remain in memory.

---

## Concurrency Management

### Thread Handling
- **Purpose**: Using threads allows the server to handle multiple client requests simultaneously.
- **Explanation**: Each incoming client request is handled by a separate thread, making the server scalable and responsive to multiple clients.

### Semaphore & Mutex
- **Purpose**: The semaphore and mutex ensure that only a set number of threads can access shared resources like the cache.
- **Explanation**: The semaphore controls access to resources, while the mutex prevents multiple threads from accessing the cache simultaneously, maintaining data integrity.

---

## Error Handling

### Error Messages
- **Purpose**: Provides feedback in case of errors.
- **Explanation**: If an error occurs during client communication or resource access, appropriate error messages are logged to help diagnose issues.

### Conclusion
This document provides an overview of the main components of the multithreaded web server with LRU cache. Each section explains the role of critical pieces of the code, from thread management to the caching mechanism. This server design ensures optimal performance, concurrency, and resource management.
